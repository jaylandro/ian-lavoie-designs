      A brick mason by trade from the age of eighteen, Ian Lavoie built a profitable business before turning to stonework in his early twenties. He honed his craft for a decade, studying the ins and outs of stone masonry, before launching into the Bay Area in 2012.

      He started out locally, doing work in the Central Massachusetts area, in and around Worcester, where he lived with his family. After many years, through networking with various clients and fellow tradesmen, Ian decided to take a job in Woodside, CA. While he was familiar with the Cape, he instantly felt a sense of comfort working in Woodside, CA, creating beautiful stonework for everyone to enjoy, and has worked exclusively on the Cape ever since. He takes pride in hiring locally.

      Today, Ian and his crew bring over thirty years of deep, thoughtful experience to every project they take on—and the more complicated and unique the project, the better. Ian and his crew prides themselves on their ability to work through engineering challenges with architects and landscape designers. As Ian says, “We feel honored when a homeowner selects us as their stonemasons.”
